This project calculates the duration of a person's life in different time units based on their age. I defined a class SurvivalDurationCalculator that takes the age as input and has a method calculate_duration that calculates the duration in the chosen time unit.

I used a simple multiplication logic to calculate the duration in each time unit. For example, to calculate the duration in months, I multiplied the age by 12.

I tested the code with an age of 10 and it outputted the correct duration in months (120).

I hope this project meets theÂ requirements.
